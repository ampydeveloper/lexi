    <p class="c6"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span>Programming languages use a lot of symbols that are abbreviations for important concepts. Among
            the most common are Boolean And (&amp;&amp;) and Boolean Or (||). These are generally used as part of an IF
            statement.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span>The Boolean And ties together two or more booleans (a variable or statement that results in a
            true/false value). For example, if I only wear my raincoat on days when I have to go to school And it's
            raining, I can express that like this:</span></p>
    <ol class="c10 lst-kix_wzg7bdpdqjoq-0 start" start="1">
        <div class="button-run-docs" index="0"></div><textarea>weekday = true
    raining = true
    if (weekday &amp;&amp; raining) {
    &nbsp; text('Better wear your raincoat',75,500)
    }
    </textarea>
    </ol>
    <p class="c8"><span>The contents of the if block will only be executed if both the variables are true.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span>The Boolean Or also ties together two or more booleans, but it evaluates to true if any of the
            variables are true. For example, if I get to sleep in on the weekends Or on snow days, I can express that
            like this:</span></p>
    <ol class="c10 lst-kix_nvwtxrpxqm5c-0 start" start="1">
        <div class="button-run-docs" index="1"></div><textarea>weekend = false
    snowday = true
    if (weekend || snowday) {
    &nbsp; text('Sleep in today!')
    }
    </textarea>
    </ol>
    <p class="c8"><span>The contents of the if block will be executed if it's a weekend, or if it's a snow day (or if
            it's both a weekend and a snow day).</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p>
