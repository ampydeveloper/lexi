    <p class="c6"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span class="c38">A function is a set of commands that are grouped together and named so that they can
            be used more easily in your code. You should create a function if you need your program to do the same
            sequence of commands more than once. Using functions makes your code shorter and easier to manage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c6"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span>Lexi has two kinds of functions: </span><span class="c20">built-in
            functions</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c20">custom functions</span><span>.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span>You use some of Lexi's built-in functions—like tap, touching, and drag—to tell your program
            what to do when the user interacts with the tablet. Other built-in functions—like loop—make your program do
            something even when no one's interacting with it.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span>Custom functions are… custom. You create them whenever you need them and call them whatever you
            like.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span>This code stamps a monster and plays a sound every time the user taps the screen. The function
            tap is built in to Lexi. The function draw is a custom function we wrote and named ourselves.</span></p>
